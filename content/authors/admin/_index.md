The MFRE program is currently developing a coordinated plan for the software tools and associated econometrics, economic, and business analysis (EEBA) applications utilized within the MFRE academic program. This plan will support the following:

  - Identification of the select software tools to be emphasized in the MFRE program
  - Coordination and incorporation of software tools, data sets and EEBA applications for Term 1, 2 and 3 Workshops, Labs, and Courses
  - Development of labs and workshops (software tools, EEBA, timing, content) to support student competencies and academic courses
  - Identification of the software and EEBA competencies that students gain via the MFRE program.
